        # What is Streaming?
                            1.  Streaming is a method of transmitting or receiving data (especially video and audio material) over the internet as a continuous flow, 
                                allowing playback to start while the rest of the data is still being received.

                      :     2.  Streaming refers to the continuous transmission of audio, video, or other media files from a server to a client. 
                                Instead of downloading an entire file before playing it, streaming allows users to start consuming the content as soon as a small 
                                amount of data has been received. 

                            3.  This is achieved through a process of data being sent in a steady, real-time flow.



        # Real-Life Scenario: Watching a Movie on Netflix
                            
                Imagine you're sitting down to watch a movie on Netflix.Here's how streaming works in this context:

                        Initial Request:
                                    You select a movie to watch. When you press play, your device (TV, computer, smartphone) 
                                    sends a request to Netflix's servers to start streaming the movie.
        
                        Buffering:
                                    Netflix begins to send small chunks of the movie data to your device. This is called buffering. 
                                    The first few seconds of the movie are loaded into your device's memory before playback begins to ensure smooth viewing.
                        
                        Continuous Data Flow:
                                    As you watch the movie, Netflix continues to send more data in small chunks. 
                                    Your device keeps downloading these chunks and buffering ahead of what youâ€™re currently watching. 
                                    This ensures there is no interruption even if there are minor delays in the data transmission.
        
                        Real-Time Adjustments:
                                    If your internet connection speed changes, Netflix adjusts the quality of the video. 
                                    For example, if your connection slows down, the video quality may drop to avoid buffering or pauses. 
                                    Conversely, if the connection improves, the quality increases.
        
        
                Everyday Examples:
                        Music Streaming     : Using services like Spotify or Apple Music, where you can start listening to songs without waiting for them to download completely.
                        Live Sports         : Watching live events on platforms like ESPN or YouTube Live, where the broadcast happens in real-time.
                        Video Conferencing  : Using Zoom or Microsoft Teams, where video and audio data stream in real-time, allowing for live interaction.
