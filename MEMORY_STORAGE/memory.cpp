        # Computer memory types divided in three parts as :

                            1.  Primary Memory      [VOLATILE]
                            2.  Secoundary Memory   [NON - VOLATILE]   
                            3.  Tertiary Memory     [REMOVABLE STOARGE]




        1} Primary Memory:
                            1)RAM
                            2)ROM

                            
                        1) RAM : Random Access Memory

                                1.  RAM (Random Access Memory) is a type of computer memory that is volatile,meaning it loses its data when the power is turned off. 
                                2.  It is used by the computer to store data that is actively being used or processed by the CPU. 
                                3.  RAM allows data to be read and written quickly, which is essential for the smooth performance of applications and the operating system.     

                                            Characteristics of RAM :

                                                Volatility:
                                                            RAM is volatile, meaning it requires a constant power supply to retain data. When the power is turned off, all data stored in RAM is lost.
                                                
                                                Speed:
                                                            RAM is much faster than other types of storage like hard drives or SSDs. This speed is critical for the performance of applications and the operating system.
                                                
                                                Capacity:
                                                            The amount of RAM in a system determines how many applications can run simultaneously and how much data can be processed quickly. Modern computers typically have between 4GB and 64GB of RAM, depending on their intended use.
                                                
                                                Latency:
                                                            RAM has low latency, meaning it can respond quickly to requests from the CPU. This low latency is essential for tasks that require quick data access.

                                Types of RAM:

                                    a) DRAM  (Dynamic RAM)
                                    b) SRAM  (Static RAM)    

                                            a. DRAM:
